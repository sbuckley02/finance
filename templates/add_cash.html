However, the inventor of the word, the man himself, Steve Wilhite, declared that the word should be pronounced like "jif." The inventor of a word should get to decide how that word is pronounced. Plus, does "jif" not sound much cooler than "gif?" If it did not, why would the peanut butter brand not be called "gif"?

It is pure gold, from the hilariousness of the main characters, like Michael Scott or Dwight Schrute, to the impact that the background characters have, like Kevin Malone or Creed. The Big Bang Theory just doesn't have that. Its characters are simply stereotypes, with no depth of character whatsoever. Also, if a show has to tell the audience when to laugh (I'm referring to the obnoxious laugh track), there's a problem.","We do know what the meaning of life is: 42.
